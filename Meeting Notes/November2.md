 # Things Finished
- added possible tasks to github board
- organized board; "in progress" for current sprint, to-do for next sprint, icebox for future sprints
- established epics in board
    - admin
    - database
    - UI
    - general function
    - system design
- planned out current & next sprint
    - sprints = 1 week of work. 1 week = time between TA meetings (monday to monday)

- planned GH branch structure
    - main/master branch
        - subbranches: per feature
        - further/extra branches = for modular/feature development, specific tasks

 # Things to Do

## Leonora

## Michael
- UI for login/register pages

## Birwa

# Other Notes
- for birwa & josh: figure out how to connect the repo and project board? may need your guys' perms (owners of the two things)
- check w/ cory regarding what "a week" is; is it monday to monday (since those are our TA meetings?) sunday to sunday? what's the specific timeline. the instructions on the website are unclear

## Feature Ideas
- for assigning users to a project: a dropdown menu that populates w/ usernames from the users database?
- managers can add users to a project and grant/revoke manager permissions to other users
    - manager status NOT part of account creation
