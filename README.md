# Application Description
A portal that allows for employees and employers to update information regarding projects that they are working on/managing. This is a site that will allow for managers to stay updated with employee work as well as reallocate employees with ease between projects. Employees will be able to easily update their work as well as collaborate with colleagues working on the same project. The features of this site will include a profile, projects and their progress, as well as access to view other employees and their projects. The user interface will prompt the user to login, or create an account if they do not have one, get assigned to projects, which the administrator will assign and have access to all projects company wide, and update their progress on their projects.
