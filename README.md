# Application Description
An onboarding portal that allows for employees and employers to update information regarding projects that they are working on/managing. This is a site any company can use to onboard new employees and current employees can navigate through their projects and other projects interdepartmentally. The features of this site will include a profile, projects and progress of the projects, access to view other employees and their projects. The user interface will prompt the user to first create a profile, during onboarding, get assigned to projects, which the administrator will assign and have access to all projects company wide, and update their progress on their projects.

Moreover, the site will provide the company with a separate tab for new employees to get familiar with the work environment and other information the company would like their employees to have access to. This is an essential part of onboarding for new employees to feel welcome. The site will also include who is working on what project and which department each employee is currently in. This will ensure new employees can become familiar with who is on their team and thus making the onboarding process run smoothly.
